        Every now and then, on the platforms of the communities I am active on, someone pops and says something along the lines of:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="flex items-center p-4 my-8 text-sm bg-gray-800 rounded shadow-md sm:m-8">
        <div class="self-start flex-none hidden w-8 mr-4 overflow-hidden rounded-full sm:block">

            <source srcset="avatar.webp" type="image/webp" alt="Avatar" />
            <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />

        <div>
          <h2 class="mb-1 text-gray-500">Foobar123</h2>
          <p>Hi, can I ask something?</p>
        </div>

      <p class="mt-4"><span class="text-red-400">This is bad form</span>, for several reasons. What the person is actually asking here is:</p>

      <blockquote class="flex items-center p-4 my-8 text-sm bg-gray-800 rounded shadow-md sm:m-8">
        <div class="self-start flex-none hidden w-8 mr-4 overflow-hidden rounded-full sm:block">
          <picture class="object-cover" title="Avatar">
            <source srcset="avatar.webp" type="image/webp" alt="Avatar" />
            <img src="avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />
          </picture>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class="mb-1 text-gray-500">Foobar123</h2>
          <p>
            Any Tailwind CSS experts around who are willing to <span class="text-red-200">commit into looking into my problem</span>, whatever that may turn out to be,
            <span class="text-red-200">even if it's not actually related to Tailwind</span> or if someone who doesn't know anything about Tailwind could actually answer my
            question?

      <p class="my-8">
        There are plenty of reasons why people who <b>do</b> have the knowledge would not admit to it. By asking,
        <span class="text-red-400">you're asking for more than what you think you're asking</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="my-8">
        <span class="text-red-400">You're asking people to take responsibility</span>. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling
        other people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I have never used, because the answers are, in a programmer kind of way, common sense.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8">
        <span class="text-teal-400">The solution is not to ask to ask, but to just ask</span>. Someone who is idling on the channel and only every now and then glances what's going
        on is unlikely to answer to your "asking to ask" question,
        <span class="text-teal-400">but your actual problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer</span>.
